# Minecraft Language Randomizer

Minecraft Language Randomizer is a Java project for randomizing the language files of Minecraftâ„¢.

## Usage

To use, navigate to 'Minecraft_Lang_Randomizer/src/main/Main.java', enter any integer into the 'seed' field. Choose which things you would like to randomize, (i.e. 'block','entity', or 'item'), and set those to true. Once you have chosen the types you would like to randomize, run the program. The output will appear in 'Minecraft_Lang_Randomizer/src/out/', and you can move the folder named something like 'Shuffled Language [&#39]' to 'resourcepacks' in your '.minecraft' folder.

If you want to use another language, you can! Take the other lang (JSON) file and place it in the 'Minecraft_Lang_Randomizer/src/resources' folder, then change the 'languageFile' in Main.java to the name of the new file.
